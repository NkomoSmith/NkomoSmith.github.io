In bubbles mini challenge I created 6 bubbles that are set at a random position. To do this I used
a draw function and used the object ellipse to create the circles. An object is pretty much everything
in javascript. An object contains data values in your code. Objects are very benificial when working
in java script because objects can contain many values. One struggle I had doing this project was geting
aclimated with p5 because it was the first project we have done in p5 and might take some time to get
use to.
